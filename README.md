# BumpAssemblyVersions

`BumpAssemblyVersions` is an *MSBuild 15+* task that bumps *Visual Studio 2017+* project version properties and assembly attributes. Testing has been done against [_CSharp_](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/csharp) projects only, i.e. [`.csproj`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-forms/overview/deployment/web-deployment-in-the-enterprise/understanding-the-project-file) or [`AssemblyInfo.cs`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/set-attributes) files, at this time.

We have also [_migrated_](../../wiki) our repository documentation into the [_wiki area_](../../wiki). Has been reviewed for link integrity, however, if you [_find an issue_](../../issues/new/choose) with the documentation, a link, do not hesitate to [_contact us_](../../issues/new/choose), make us aware, we would love to help. If you [_have an idea_](../../discussions/new/choose), maybe float a strategy concept our way, but it is not an issue, per se, we would like to [_hear about it_](../../discussions/new/choose) as well. Contributions, support, are always welcome, as well.
